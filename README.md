# Crypto Srbija (my first GitHub baby)

Hey there, future me (or brave stranger). This repo might look painfully ordinary from the outside - it's pure HTML, vanilla CSS, and some enthusiastic `setInterval` in plain JS. No frameworks, no build scripts, nothing "impressive" for recruiters. But this folder is priceless to me because it's literally the first thing I ever pushed to GitHub. Hitting commit on it felt like opening a new chapter.

I keep its rough edges on full display as souvenirs:

- `index.html` still has that runaway `</div>` after the footer (`index.html:78`), because apparently I thought divs multiply like rabbits.
- I duplicated `id="kriptologo"` for different images (`index.html:58`, `index.html:68`) and learned the hard way that IDs are supposed to be unique.
- Every hero image proudly uses `alt=""` (`index.html:33` et al.), so screen readers get a whole lot of silence.
- The countdown script (`Skripte/index.js:1`) shouts everything with `var`, as if `let` and `const` hadnâ€™t been invented yet.

These little mistakes make me smile now. They remind me how far I've come and how much I'm still growing. I can refactor, restructure, and polish today but I keep this project exactly as it was on day one so I never forget the rush of figuring things out for the first time.

If you wandered in here looking for something fancy, sorry to disappoint. But if you want something more interesting, check out my other, more complex repositories on GitHub.
